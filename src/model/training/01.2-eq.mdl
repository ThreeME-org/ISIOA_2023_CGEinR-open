##### Basic model

##! Production (GDP)
Y = CH + I + G

##! Households consumption
CH = 0.6 * Y{-1}

##! Investment
I = 0.25 * Y
									# Equivalent to: 
									# d(log(I)) = d(log(Y))
									# Because :
									# log(I) = log(0.25 * Y)
									# log(I) = log(0.25) + log(Y)
									# log(I) - log(I{-1}) = log(0.25) + log(Y) - (log(0.25) + log(Y{-1}))
									# d(log(I)) = d(log(Y))
