# Unused file
# Dynamo compiler require a file 
# See line 8 of "dynamo.R"
#
#    "# CountryCalib",
#    str_c(threeme_path, "data/shadowfile_readme.mdl"),
#    "",
#    "# ListsParameters",
#   # str_c(threeme_path, "model/R_lists_", iso3, ".mdl"),
#   # str_c(threeme_path, "model/lists.mdl"),
#   # str_c(threeme_path, "data/parameters.mdl"),
 
# No need to put information in "# CountryCalib" or "# ListsParameters"
# But bug when "# CountryCalib"  is empty
# "# ListsParameters" can be empty
# Every thing is in config.R : calib_file
# It look that Dynamo is a bit (0.2 second) faster if the str_c("data/R_Calibration_", iso3, ".mdl") is put first.
# This file can be deleted with dynamo is corrected.
